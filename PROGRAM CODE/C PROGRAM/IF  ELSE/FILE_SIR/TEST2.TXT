In this program we have opened the file for reading. Suppose we
open a file with an intention to write characters into it. This time
too a buffer would get associated with it. When we attempt to
write characters into this file using fputc( ) the characters would
get written to the buffer. When we close this file using fclose( )
three operations would be performed:
(a) The characters in the buffer would be written to the file on the disk.
(b) At the end of file a character with ASCII value 26 would get written.
(c) The buffer would be eliminated from memory. 

You can imagine a possibility when the buffer may become full
before we close the file. In such a case the buffer’s contents would
be written to the disk the moment it becomes full. All this buffer
management is done for us by the library functions.
